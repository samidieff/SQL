In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.


--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) 
who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").--

SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM customers
WHERE country <> 'US'
;


--Show only the Customers from Brazil. --

SELECT firstname, lastname, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = ‘Brazil';


—-Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table 
should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, 
and billing country.

SELECT cust.firstname, cust.lastname, 
i.invoiceid, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM invoices as i
LEFT JOIN customers as cust
ON i.InvoiceId=cust.customerid
WHERE i.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'


---Show the Employees who are Sales Agents

SELECT employeeid, lastname, firstname, title
FROM employees
WHERE title like '%Sales%Agent%'


---Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.firstname, emp.lastname, inv.invoiceid, emp.Title
FROM employees as emp
INNER JOIN customers as cust
ON emp.employeeid=cust.CustomerId
INNER JOIN invoices as inv
ON cust.customerid=inv.InvoiceId
WHERE emp.Title like '%Sales%Agent%'
;


---Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT inv.billingcountry, inv.total, cust.firstname as cfirstname, cust.lastname as clastname, 
emp.firstname, emp.lastname 
FROM employees as emp
JOIN customers as cust
ON emp.employeeid=cust.customerid
JOIN invoices as inv
ON cust.CustomerId=inv.InvoiceId;


---How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(total)
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate like '%2009%';


---What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'


---Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.InvoiceLineId, albums.Title
FROM albums
JOIN invoice_items as inv
ON albums.AlbumId=inv.InvoiceLineId
;


---Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT inv.InvoiceLineId, albums.Title, art.name
FROM albums
JOIN invoice_items as inv
ON albums.AlbumId=inv.InvoiceLineId
JOIN artists as art
ON art.artistid=albums.AlbumId
;


---Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT albums.title as album_title, tracks.Name as track_name, 
mt.name as media_type, genres.name as genre
FROM albums
JOIN tracks
ON albums.AlbumId=tracks.AlbumId
JOIN media_types as mt
ON tracks.AlbumId=mt.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres
ON mt.MediaTypeId=genres.GenreId;


****---I wanna know the playlist name, track name, track id, album name, 

SELECT play.name as playlist_name, 
  tracks.trackid as trackID, 
  tracks.Name as track_name, 
  alb.title as album_title, 
  artists.Name as artist_name
FROM artists
JOIN albums as alb
ON artists.artistid=alb.artistid
JOIN tracks
ON alb.artistid=tracks.TrackId
JOIN playlist_track
ON tracks.trackid=playlist_track.TrackId
JOIN playlists as play
ON playlist_track.playlistid=play.PlaylistId
ORDER BY playlist_name;


---Show all countries where music was purchased

SELECT billingcountry FROM invoices
GROUP BY billingcountry;


---Show the total sales per country

SELECT billingcountry, SUM(total)
FROM invoices
GROUP BY billingcountry
;


---Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM Employees emp

JOIN Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
