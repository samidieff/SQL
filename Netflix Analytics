In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 


#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';


#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 

SELECT date_added, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY date_added desc;


SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";
SELECT type, title


#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 

SELECT type, title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY title;


#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 

SELECT
director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nt
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
ON nt.show_id=np.show_id
WHERE nt.title='Bright Star';

SELECT 
np.show_id,
np.director,
nt.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" np
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nt
ON np.show_id=nt.show_id
WHERE nt.title='Bright Star';


#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 

SELECT
title
release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;


SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'); 


#6. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
